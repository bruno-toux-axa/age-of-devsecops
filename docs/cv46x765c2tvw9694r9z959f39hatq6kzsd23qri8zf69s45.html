    <p>Some dependencies in your application are vulnerable! You have to find a tool to find out which one you need to
        update. Of course, you need to make sure that you didn't break anything along the way (in real life dependencies
        update is a hell!).</p>

    <p>Refer to the guide in your Starter Kit for more information about IP, SSH keys, etc.</p>
