    <p>You need to have solved the Sonar challenge before starting this!</p>
    <p>The ugly system we provided is really ugly! You need to refactor it, fix all bugs and remove code smells.
        We are not proud about the test coverage, so you need to write some tests to cover your code. We expect from you
        to reach at least 80% of test coverage.</p>
    <p>We are not stupid, simply removing the ugly code or writing tests without assertions won't work :P</p>
