<div class="content">
    <p>Your team as been given a virtual machine named "Build" to build and deploy your application. A simple
        Jenkins pipeline is already configure. On the same machine, a Sonar instance is already installed.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, it is not configured properly and no metrics of code quality are measured.
        Your mission is to edit your Jenkins configuration and add a Sonar analysis step in your CI.</p>

    <p>Before you go, wouldn't it be useful to learn a bit about <a
            href="https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/getting-started/" target="_blank">Jenkins declarative
        pipelines</a>? And about the <a
            href="https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner+for+Jenkins" target="_blank">SonarQube
        Scanner plugin for Jenkins</a>?</p>

    <p>Refer to the guide in your Starter Kit for more information about IP, SSH keys, etc.</p>
